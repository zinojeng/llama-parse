These models set standards in several benchmarks such as Video Captioning (VATEX), Visual QA (TextVQA), Function Calling (BFCL), and multimodal agentic benchmarks (GroundUI-1K, VisualWebBench, Mind2Web) in their respective intelligence tiers.

We curated data from over 200 languages, with particular emphasis on Arabic, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, and Turkish. After pretraining, models iteratively went through a series of fine-tuning stages, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on instruction-demonstration pairs (including multimodal ones) and reward model (RM) training from human preference data [59]. Finally, the models learned from human preferences via methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [62] and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [68] to ensure that the final models are aligned with human preferences in both quality and responsibility.\n",

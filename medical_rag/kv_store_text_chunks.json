Severe metabolic decompensation can be, and was, mostly prevented with once- or twice-daily insulin injections for the six or seven decades after the discovery of insulin.\n\nOver the past four decades, evidence has accumulated supporting more intensive insulin replacement, using multiple daily injections of insulin or continuous subcutaneous administration through an insulin pump, as providing the best combination of effectiveness and safety for people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive therapy with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) reduced A1C and was associated with improved long-term outcomes (1–3). The study was carried out with short-acting (regular) and intermediate-acting (NPH) human insulins. In this landmark trial, lower A1C with intensive management (7%) led to 50% reductions in microvascular complications over 6 years of treatment. However, intensive therapy was associated with a higher rate of severe hypoglycemia than conventional treatment (62 compared with 19 episodes per 100 person-years of therapy) (1).\n\nFollow-up of participants from the DCCT demonstrated fewer macrovascular and microvascular complications in the group that received intensive treatment. Achieving intensive glycemic goals during the active treatment period of the study had a persistent beneficial impact over the 20 years after the active treatment component of the study ended (1–3).\n\nInsulin replacement plans typically consist of basal insulin, mealtime insulin, and correction insulin (Fig. 9.1) (4). Basal insulin includes NPH insulin, long-acting insulin analogs, and continuous delivery of rapid-acting insulin via an insulin pump. Basal insulin analogs",

Achieving intensive glycemic goals during the active treatment period of the study had a persistent beneficial impact over the 20 years after the active treatment component of the study ended (1–3).\n\nInsulin replacement plans typically consist of basal insulin, mealtime insulin, and correction insulin (Fig. 9.1) (4). Basal insulin includes NPH insulin, long-acting insulin analogs, and continuous delivery of rapid-acting insulin via an insulin pump. Basal insulin analogs have longer duration of action with flatter, more constant and consistent plasma concentrations and activity profiles than NPH insulin; rapid-acting analogs (RAA) have a quicker onset and peak and shorter duration of action than regular human insulin.\n\nIn people with type 1 diabetes, treatment with analog insulins is associated with less hypoglycemia and weight gain and lower A1C compared with injectable human insulins (5–7). Two injectable ultra-rapid-acting insulin formulations are available that contain excipients that accelerate absorption and provide more activity in the first portion of their profile compared with the other RAA (8,9). Inhaled human insulin has a rapid peak and shortened duration of action compared with RAA (10).\n\nThe impact of the introduction of interchangeable biosimilars and unbranded versions of some analog products as well as current and upcoming price reductions on insulin access need to be evaluated. Reassessment of insulin-taking behavior and adjustment of treatment plans to account for specific factors, including cost, that impact choice of treatment is recommended at regular intervals (every 3–6 months).\n\nMost studies comparing multiple daily injections with CSII have been relatively small and of short duration. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that CSII via pump therapy has modest advantages for lowering A1C (0.30% [95% CI 0.58 to 0.02]) and for reducing severe hypoglycemia rates in children and adults (15). Use of CSII is associated with improvement in quality of life, particularly in areas related to fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes distress, compared with multiple daily injections.\n---\n\n# Table 9.1—Examples of subcutaneous insulin treatment plans\n\n| Plans | Timing and distribution | Advantages | Disadvantages | Adjusting doses |\n|-------|-------------------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Plans that more closely mimic normal insulin secretion |\n| Insulin pump therapy (also including AID systems: hybrid closed-loop, low-glucose suspend, CGM-augmented open-loop, BGM-augmented open-loop) | Basal delivery of URAA or RAA; generally 30–50% of TDD. Mealtime and correction: URAA or RAA by bolus based on ICR and/or ISF and target glucose, with premeal insulin ~15 min before eating. | Can adjust basal rates for varying insulin sensitivity by time of day, for exercise, and for sick days. Flexibility in meal timing and content. Pump can deliver insulin in increments of fractions of units. Potential for integration with CGM for AID systems. TIR % highest and TBR % lowest with: hybrid closed-loop > low-glucose suspend > CGM-augmented open-loop > BGM-augmented open-loop. | Most expensive plan. Must continuously wear one or more devices. Risk of rapid development of ketosis or DKA with interruption of insulin delivery. Potential reactions to adhesives and site infections. Most technically complex approach (harder for people with lower numeracy or literacy skills). | Mealtime insulin: if carbohydrate counting is accurate, change ICR if glucose after meal consistently out of target. Correction insulin: adjust ISF and/or target glucose if correction does not consistently bring glucose into range. Basal rates: adjust based on overnight, fasting or daytime glucose outside of activity of URAA/RAA bolus. AID systems: carbohydrate ratio, insulin on board, targets, and/or ISF may be adjusted, depending on the system. Make sure to review and adjust manual mode settings, if available. |\n| MDI: LAA + flexible doses of URAA or RAA at meals | LAA once daily (insulin detemir or insulin glargine may require twice-daily dosing); generally 30–50% of TDD. Mealtime and correction: URAA or RAA based on ICR and/or ISF and target glucose. | Can use pens for all components. Flexibility in meal timing and content. Insulin analogs cause less hypoglycemia than human insulins. | At least four daily injections. Most costly insulins. Smallest increment of insulin is 1 unit (0.5 unit with some pens). LAAs may not cover strong dawn phenomenon (rise in glucose in early morning hours) as well as pump therapy. | Mealtime insulin: if carbohydrate counting is accurate, change ICR if glucose after meal consistently out of target. Correction insulin: adjust ISF and/or target glucose if correction does not consistently bring glucose into range. LAA: based on overnight or fasting glucose or daytime glucose outside of activity time course, or URAA or RAA injections. |\n| MDI plans with less flexibility |\n| Four injections daily with fixed doses of N and RAA | Pre-breakfast: RAA ~20% of TDD.

However, there is no consensus to guide the choice of injection or pump therapy in a given individual, and research to guide this decision-making is needed (4). Integration of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) into the treatment plan soon after diagnosis improves glycemic outcomes, decreases hypoglycemic events, and improves quality of life for individuals with type 1 diabetes (18–23). Its use is now considered standard of care for most people with type 1 diabetes (4) (see Section 7, “Diabetes Technology”). Reduction of nocturnal hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps with CGM is improved by automatic suspension of insulin delivery at a preset glucose level, with further improvements when using devices with predictive low-glucose insulin delivery suspension (24,25).\n\nAutomated insulin delivery (AID) systems are safe and effective for people with type 1 diabetes. Randomized controlled trials and real-world studies have demonstrated the ability of commercially available systems to improve achievement of glycemic goals while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia (26–31). Data are emerging on the safety and effectiveness of do-it-yourself systems (32,33). Evidence suggests that an AID hybrid closed-loop system is superior to AID sensor-augmented pump therapy for increased percentage of time in range and reduction of hypoglycemia (34,35).\n\n# Insulin Administration Technique\n\nEnsuring that individuals and/or caregivers understand correct insulin administration technique is important to optimize glycemic management and insulin use safety. Recommendations have been published outlining best practices for insulin administration (66). Proper insulin administration technique includes the following: injection, insertion of patch or infusion (for CSII or AID systems) into appropriate body areas, or oral inhalation (inhaled human insulin); injection or infusion site rotation; appropriate care of injection or infusion sites to avoid infection or other complications; avoidance of intramuscular (IM) insulin delivery; and filling of the reservoir (for bolus patch, CSII, or AID systems) or inhaler (for inhaled human insulin) depending on the method of administration. Selection of method of administration (vial and syringe, insulin pen, insulin patch, inhaled insulin, connected insulin pens/devices, or insulin pumps) will depend on a variety of individual-specific factors and needs, cost and coverage, and individual preferences. Reassessment of the appropriate administration technique should be completed during routine follow-up.\n---\n# Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\n\n# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025\n\nExogenously delivered insulin should be injected or infused into subcutaneous tissue, not intramuscularly. Recommended sites for insulin administration include the abdomen, thigh, buttock, and upper arm. Insulin absorption from IM sites differs from that in subcutaneous sites and is also influenced by the activity of the muscle. Inadvertent IM injection can lead to unpredictable insulin absorption and variable effects on glucose and is associated with frequent and unexplained hypoglycemia. Risk for IM insulin delivery is increased in younger, leaner individuals when injecting into the limbs rather than truncal sites (abdomen and buttocks) and when using longer needles. Recent evidence supports the use of short needles (e.g., 4-mm pen needles) as effective and well tolerated compared with longer needles, including a study performed in adults with obesity.\n\nInjection or infusion site rotation is additionally necessary to avoid lipohypertrophy, an accumulation of subcutaneous fat in response to the adipogenic actions of insulin at a site of multiple injections. Lipohypertrophy appears as soft, smooth raised areas several centimeters in breadth and can contribute to erratic insulin absorption, increased glycemic variability, and unexplained hypoglycemic episodes. People treated with insulin and/or caregivers should receive education about proper injection or infusion site rotation and how to recognize and avoid injecting in areas of lipohypertrophy. As noted in Table 4.1, examination of insulin administration sites for the presence of lipohypertrophy, as well as assessment of administration device use and injection technique, are key components of a comprehensive diabetes medical evaluation and treatment plan. Proper insulin injection, infusion, or inhalation technique may lead to more effective use of this therapy and, as such, holds the potential for improved clinical outcomes.\n\n# SURGICAL TREATMENT OF TYPE 1 DIABETES\n\n# Pancreas and Islet Transplantation\n\nSuccessful pancreas and islet transplantation can normalize glucose levels and mitigate microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes. However, people receiving these treatments require lifelong immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection and/or recurrence of autoimmune islet destruction. Given the potential adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy, pancreas transplantation should be reserved for people with type 1 diabetes undergoing simultaneous kidney transplantation, following kidney transplantation, or for those with recurrent ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia despite optimized glycemic management. In much of the world, allogenic islet transplantation is regulated as an organ transplant. However, in the U.S., allogenic islet transplantation is regulated as a cell therapy, and the first such allogeneic islet cell therapy, donislecel-jujn, was approved in 2023. Donislecel is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes who are unable to reach their A1C goals because of repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia despite intensive diabetes management and education.\n\n# Noninsulin Treatments for Type 1 Diabetes\n\nInjectable and oral noninsulin glucose-lowering medications have been studied for their efficacy as adjuncts to insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes.

Pramlintide is based on the naturally occurring b-cell peptide amylin and is approved for use in adults with type 1 diabetes. Clinical trials have demonstrated a modest reduction in A1C (0.3–0.4%) and modest weight loss (1 kg) with pramlintide. Similar results have been reported for several agents currently approved only for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The addition of metformin in adults with type 1 diabetes was associated with small reductions in body weight, insulin dose, and lipid levels but did not sustainably improve A1C. The largest clinical trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabetes have been conducted with liraglutide 1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest A1C reductions (0.4%), decreases in weight (5 kg), and reductions in insulin doses. Liraglutide was also assessed for impact on C-peptide in individuals with type 1 diabetes and residual b-cell function. During treatment, there was no impact, and with liraglutide discontinuation, there was worsening of C-peptide loss compared with placebo.\n\n# PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES\n\n# Recommendations\n\nHealthy behaviors, diabetes self-management education and support, avoidance of therapeutic inertia, and social determinants of health should be considered.\n---\n# Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\n\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\n\nDownloaded from diabetesjournals.org by guest on 09 December 2024\n\n# Figure 9.2\n\nSimpliﬁed overview of indications for b-cell replacement therapy in people with type 1 diabetes.

In general, higher-efficacy approaches, including combination therapy, have greater likelihood of achieving treatment goals. Weight management is a distinct treatment goal, along with glycemic management, as it has multifaceted benefits, including reduction of A1C, reduction in hepatic steatosis, and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors (89–91). For individuals with type 2 diabetes who require initiation or intensification of glucose-lowering therapy to achieve and/or maintain individualized glycemic goals and who do not have additional considerations informing choice of therapy beyond need for glucose lowering, metformin is a commonly used medication that historically has been the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes (92,93). Metformin is effective and safe, is inexpensive and widely available, and reduces risks of microvascular complications, cardiovascular events, and death (92,94,95). Metformin is available in an immediate-release form for twice-daily dosing or as an extended-release form that can be given once daily. Compared with sulfonylureas, metformin as first-line therapy has beneficial effects on A1C, is weight neutral, does not cause hypoglycemia, and reduces cardiovascular mortality (96). Metformin is also more effective than dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in lowering A",

Compared with sulfonylureas, metformin as first-line therapy has beneficial effects on A1C, is weight neutral, does not cause hypoglycemia, and reduces cardiovascular mortality (96). Metformin is also more effective than dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in lowering A1C and weight when used as monotherapy (97).\n\nThe principal side effects of metformin are gastrointestinal intolerance due to bloating, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea; these can be mitigated by gradual dose titration and/or using extended-release formulation. The drug is cleared by kidney filtration, and metformin may be safely used in people with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m² (98). Very high circulating levels (e.g., as a result of overdose or acute kidney injury) have been associated with lactic acidosis (99). However, the occurrence of this complication is very rare (100) and primarily occurs when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is <30 mL/min/1.73 m² (101). For people with an eGFR of 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m², there is an increased risk for periodic decreases of eGFR to ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m² which heightens the risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin use is also associated with increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and worsening of symptoms of neuropathy (102,103), suggesting periodic testing of vitamin B12 levels (see Section 3, “Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities”).\n\nWhen A1C is ≥1.5% above the individualized glycemic goal (see Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia,” for appropriate goals), many individuals will require dual-combination therapy or a more potent glucose-lowering agent to achieve and maintain their goal A1C level (89) (Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2). Insulin should be considered as part of any combination medication plan when hyperglycemia is severe, especially if catabolic features (weight loss, hypertriglyceridemia, and ketosis) are present. It is common practice to initiate insulin therapy for people who present with blood glucose levels ≥300 mg/dL (≥16.7 mmol/L) or A1C >10% (>86 mmol/mol) or if the individual has symptoms of hyperglycemia (i.e., polyuria or polydipsia) or evidence of catabolism (unexpected weight loss) (Fig. 9.4). As glucose toxicity resolves, simplifying the medication plan and/or changing to noninsulin agents is possible. Additionally, there is evidence that people with type 2 diabetes and severe hyperglycemia can also be effectively treated with a sulfonylurea, a GLP-1 RA, or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, though evidence is scarce for individuals with baseline A1C above 10–12% (104,109–111).\n\n# Combination Therapy\n\nBecause type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, maintenance of glycemic goals often requires combination therapy. Traditional recommendations have called for the use of stepwise addition of medications to metformin to maintain A1C goals. The advantage of this is to provide a clear assessment of the positive and negative effects of new drugs and reduce potential side effects and expense (112). However, some data support initial combination therapy for more rapid attainment of glycemic goals (113,114) and later combination therapy for longer durability of glycemic effect (115). Initial combination therapy should be considered in people presenting.\n---\n# Use of Glucose-Lowering Medications in the Management of Type 2 Diabetes\n\n## HEALTHY LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS; DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION AND SUPPORT; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH\n\n*To avoid therapeutic inertia, reassess and modify treatment regularly (e.g., 3–6 months)*\n\n### Goal: Cardiovascular and Kidney Risk Reduction in High-Risk Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes*\n\n#### +ASCVD†\n\n#### +Indicators of high CVD risk\n\n#### +HF\nCurrent or prior symptoms of HF with reduced or preserved LVEF or HFpEF\n\n#### +CKD\neGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m² OR [Albuminuria (ACR ≥30 mg/g)] Confirmed on two occasions.

(242).\n---\n# Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\n\nwith A1C levels 1.5–2.0% above their individualized goal. Finally, incorporation of high-glycemic-efficacy therapies or therapies for cardiovascular and kidney disease risk reduction (e.g., GLP-1 RAs, dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, and SGLT2 inhibitors) may reduce the need for agents that increase the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain or are less well tolerated. Thus, treatment intensification requires purposeful selection of medications in alignment with multiple individualized person-centered treatment goals simultaneously.\n\nTreatment intensification, deintensification, or modification, as appropriate, for people not meeting individualized treatment goals should not be delayed (therapeutic inertia). Results from comparative effectiveness meta-analyses suggest that each new class of oral noninsulin agents when added to metformin generally lowers A1C by approximately 0.7–1.0% (8–11 mmol/mol). Addition of GLP-1 RAs or the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA to metformin usually results in 1 to 2% lowering of A1C.\n\nWe do not recommend using GLP-1 RAs (or the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA) together with a DPP-4 inhibitor as there is no added glucose-lowering benefit beyond that of the GLP-1 RA alone. When even greater potency of glucose reduction is needed, basal insulin, either human NPH or a long-acting insulin analog, should be initiated. However, if the individual is not already receiving GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA therapy, an agent from these classes should be started first, as it may be sufficient for achieving individualized A1C goals but with lower risk of hypoglycemia and with favorable weight, cardiovascular, kidney, and liver profiles.\n\n# Glucose-Lowering Therapy for People With Cardiovascular Disease or Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease\n\nFor individuals with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit is recommended independent of A1C, with or without metformin use, and in consideration of person-specific factors.

Preferred medications for glucose management in individuals with CKD are GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors (can be initiated if eGFR is above 20 mL/min/1.73 m2). GLP-1 RAs are effective in lowering glucose levels, regardless of kidney function, with a low risk for hypoglycemia, and a recent clinical trial suggests that the GLP-1 RA semaglutide has a beneficial effect on CVD, mortality, and kidney outcomes among people with CKD.\n---\n# Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\n\nDiabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025\n\nleading to the recommendation that semaglutide can be used as another first-line agent for people with CKD (137,138). Other GLP-1 RAs (liraglutide and dulaglutide) may also have CKD benefits, but no other dedicated kidney trials have been published. Similarly, no dedicated kidney outcomes studies for the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA (tirzepatide) have been published. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have beneficial effects on slowing progression of CKD and CV outcomes in this population (139–141). However, their ability to lower glucose levels declines when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 (142–144). Metformin is also a preferred agent for those with CKD due to its well-documented efficacy and safety profile for all people with type 2 diabetes. However, there is no documented direct kidney benefit. Importantly, metformin should not be started in those whose eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. For those already treated with metformin, the dose of metformin should be reduced once eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and should be stopped once eGFR is <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (98).\n\nA secondary analysis of the GRADE trial found that insulin glargine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride did not prevent the development of CKD when added to metformin monotherapy in individuals without underlying CKD (145). Importantly, an SGLT2 inhibitor was not included in the GRADE trial. Individuals with CKD, particularly advanced CKD and kidney failure, are at high risk for hypoglycemia (132). If treated with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, treatment needs to be closely monitored and adjusted as eGFR declines and individuals need to be educated about and closely monitored for hypoglycemia occurrence (136). See Section 11, “Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management,” for more details about prevention and treatment of CKD in individuals with diabetes.\n\n# Insulin Therapy\n\nMany adults with type 2 diabetes eventually require and benefit from insulin therapy (Fig. 9.4). See INSULIN ADMINISTRATION TECHNIQUE, above, for guidance on how to administer insulin safely and effectively. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes should be regularly and objectively explained to individuals with diabetes, and clinicians should avoid using insulin as a threat or describing it as a sign of personal failure. The utility and importance of insulin to achieve and maintain glycemic goals once progression of the disease overcomes the effect of other agents as well as for temporary use for acute situations (such as hospitalization, acute illness, or high-dose glucocorticoid therapy) should be emphasized. Educating and involving people with diabetes in insulin management is beneficial. For example, instruction of individuals with type 2 diabetes initiating insulin on self-titration of insulin doses based on glucose monitoring improves glycemic management (163).\n\nComprehensive education regarding glucose monitoring, nutrition, physical activity, contingency planning (for illness, fasting, or medication unavailability), and the prevention and appropriate treatment of hypoglycemia are critically important for all individuals using insulin. Assessment and education tailored to improve health literacy and numeracy may be necessary for individuals to effectively use various insulin dosing strategies and tools (64,65). See Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes,” for guidance on diabetes self-management education.\n\n# Glucose-Lowering Therapy for People With Metabolic Comorbidities\n\nMany adults with diabetes, either type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes, with obesity are at high risk of developing MASLD or MASH as well as MASH cirrhosis. Hence, the presence of MASLD or MASH should be a consideration when choosing glucose-lowering medications. Obesity is present in over 90% of people with type 2 diabetes, and in these individuals weight management is a key treatment goal, along with glucose lowering. In the setting of obesity, the choice of glucose-lowering medications should take into consideration their effects on weight. Insul",

Obesity is present in over 90% of people with type 2 diabetes, and in these individuals weight management is a key treatment goal, along with glucose lowering. In the setting of obesity, the choice of glucose-lowering medications should take into consideration their effects on weight. Insulins, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones can promote weight gain and should be used judiciously and at the lowest possible dose. Glucose-lowering medications that promote weight loss should be prioritized. Of the currently available agents, tirzepatide and semaglutide have the highest efficacy in terms of glucose lowering as well as weight loss, followed by dulaglutide, liraglutide, and extended-release exenatide (157–161). Other glucose-lowering medications (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, dopamine agonists, bile acid sequestrants, and α-glucosidase inhibitors) are weight neutral or have a modest beneficial effect on weight.\n\nBasal insulin alone is the most convenient initial insulin treatment and can be added to noninsulin glucose-lowering medications. For individuals with type 2 diabetes, starting doses can be estimated based on body weight (0.1–0.2 units/kg/day) and the degree of hyperglycemia, with individualized titration over days to weeks as needed.\n---\n# Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\n\nneeded to achieve and maintain glycemic goals. The principal action of basal insulin is to restrain hepatic glucose production and limit hyperglycemia overnight and between meals (164,165). Attainment of fasting glucose goals can be achieved with human NPH insulin or a long-acting insulin analog. In clinical trials, long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine and detemir) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin (166). Longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk than U-100 glargine (167,168). It is important to understand how to convert individuals from one basal insulin to another, as switching insulins may be required due to the availability of more clinically appropriate insulin alternatives, removal of a product from the market (i.e., insulin detemir), or changes to insurance coverage. Often doses can be converted unit for unit and subsequently adjusted based on glucose monitoring; however, an initial dose reduction of 10–20% can be used for individuals in very tight management or at high risk for hypoglycemia and is typically needed when switching from insulin detemir or U-300 glargine to another insulin (169). Clinicians should also be aware of the potential for overbasalization with insulin therapy (i.e., use of higher than clinically necessary and appropriate dose of basal insulin, typically masking insufficient mealtime insulin). Clinical signals that should prompt evaluation for overbasalization include high bedtime-to-morning or preprandial-to-postprandial glucose differential (e.g., bedtime-to-morning glucose differential $50 mg/dL [$2.8 mmol/L]), hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high glucose variability. Evidence of overbasalization should prompt reevaluation of the glucose-lowering treatment plan to better address postprandial hyperglycemia (170).\n\n# Combination Injectable Therapy and Prandial Insulin\n\nIf basal insulin has been titrated to an acceptable fasting blood glucose level and A1C remains above goal, if there is evidence of significant postprandial hyperglycemia, or if signs of overbasalization are present, advancement to combination injectable therapy is necessary (Fig. 9.4). This approach can use a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA added to basal insulin or multiple doses of prandial insulin (131,171). If an individual is not already being treated with a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, a GLP-1 RA (either as an individual product or in a fixed-ratio combination with a basal insulin product) or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA should be considered prior to starting prandial insulin to address prandial management and to lower the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain associated with insulin therapy (131,172). Further intensification of insulin therapy entails adding doses of prandial insulin to basal insulin. Starting with a single prandial dose with the largest meal of the day is simple and effective, and it can be advanced to a plan with multiple prandial doses if necessary (173). We suggest starting with a prandial insulin dose of 4 units or 10% of the amount of basal insulin at the largest meal or the meal with the greatest postprandial excursion. The prandial insulin plan can then be intensified based on individual needs (Fig. 9.4). Alternatively, for an individual treated with basal insulin in whom additional prandial coverage is desired but administering insulin prior to one or more meals is not feasible, the medication plan can be converted to two doses of a premixed insulin. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. For example, basal-prandial plans offer greater flexibility for individuals who eat on irregular schedules, have variable meal content, or otherwise benefit from greater individualization and flexibility in insulin administration. On the other hand, two doses of premixed insulin is a simple, convenient means of spreading insulin across the day. Moreover, human insulins, separately, self-mixed, or as premixed",

On the other hand, two doses of premixed insulin is a simple, convenient means of spreading insulin across the day. Moreover, human insulins, separately, self-mixed, or as premixed NPH/regular (for example, 70/30) formulations, are often less costly alternatives to insulin analogs.\n\n# Concentrated Insulins\n\nConcentrated preparations may be more convenient (fewer injections to achieve goal dose) and comfortable (less volume to inject the desired dose and/or less injection effort) for individuals and may improve treatment plan engagement in those with insulin resistance who require large doses of insulin. Several concentrated insulin preparations are currently available. U-500 regular insulin is, by definition, five times more concentrated than U-100 regular insulin. U-500 regular insulin has distinct pharmacokinetics with similar onset but a delayed, blunted, and prolonged peak effect and longer duration of action compared with U-100 regular insulin; thus, it has characteristics more like a premixed intermediate-acting (NPH) and regular insulin product and can be used as two or three daily injections (177,178). U-300 glargine and U-200 degludec are three and two times, respectively, as concentrated as their U-100 formulations and allow higher doses of basal insulin administration per volume used. U-300 glargine has a longer duration of action.\n---\n# Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\n\n# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025\n\nthan U-100 glargine but modestly lower efﬁcacy per unit administered (179–181). The U-200 formulations of insulin deglu- dec, insulin lispro, and insulin lispro-aabc have pharmacokinetics similar to those of their U-100 counterparts (182–184). While U-500 regular insulin is available in both preﬁlled pens and vials, other concentrated insulins are available only in preﬁlled pens to minimize the risk of dosing errors. If U-500 regular insulin vials are prescribed, the prescription should be accompanied by a prescription for U-500 syringes to minimize the risk of dosing errors.\n\n# Alternative Insulin Routes\n\nInsulin is primarily administered via subcutaneous injection or infusion. Administration devices provide some additional variation in the subcutaneous delivery beyond vial and syringe versus insulin pen. Those devices include continuous insulin pumps (programmable or automated basal and bolus settings and fixed basal and bolus settings) and bolus-only insulin patch pump. In addition, prandial or correction insulin doses may be administered using inhaled human insulin. Inhaled insulin is available as monomers of regular human insulin; studies in individuals with type 1 diabetes suggest that inhaled insulin has pharmacokinetics similar to those of RAA (185). Studies comparing inhaled insulin with injectable insulin have demonstrated its faster onset and shorter duration compared with the RAA insulin lispro as well as clinically meaningful A1C reductions and weight reductions compared with the RAA insulin aspart over 24 weeks (186–188). Use of inhaled insulin may result in a decline in lung function (reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]). Inhaled insulin is contraindicated in individuals with chronic lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and is not recommended in individuals who smoke or who recently stopped smoking. All individuals require spirometry (FEV1) testing to identify potential lung disease prior to and after starting inhaled insulin therapy.\n\n# Medication Costs and Affordability\n\nCosts for noninsulin and insulin diabetes medications have increased dramatically over the past two decades, and an increasing proportion of cost is now passed on to people with diabetes and their families (194). Table 9.3 provides cost information for currently approved noninsulin therapies, while Table 9.4 provides these data for insulin. Of note, prices listed are average wholesale prices (AWP) (195) and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) (196); these estimates allow for a comparison of drug prices but do not represent the actual costs to people with diabetes because they do not account for various discounts, rebates, and other price adjustments often involved in prescription sales that affect the actual cost incurred by the individual. Medication costs can be a major source of stress for people with diabetes and contribute to worse medication-taking behavior (197); cost-reducing strategies may improve medication-taking behavior in some cases (198).\n\nAlthough caps on out-of-pocket costs for insulin have been implemented for individuals with Medicare and for individuals on some commercial health plans, and three major insulin manufacturers have capped costs at $35 per month per insulin (199–202) (see Section 1, “Improving Care and Promoting Health in Populations”), individuals with high-deductible health plans and those without insurance coverage can incur very high out-of-pocket expenses for glucose-lowering therapies. Moreover, no such caps exist for diabetes durable medical equipment (i.e., equipment for glucose monitoring and insulin administration).\n\n# ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES\n\n# Glucagon\n\nDue to the risk of hypoglycemia with insulin treatment, all individuals treated with insulin or who are at high risk for hypoglycemia should be prescribed glucagon. Individuals with diabetes who are prescribed glucagon and those in close contact with them should be educated on the use and administration of the individual’s prescribed glucagon product. The glucagon product available to individuals may differ based on coverage and cost; however, products that do",

Individuals with diabetes who are prescribed glucagon and those in close contact with them should be educated on the use and administration of the individual’s prescribed glucagon product. The glucagon product available to individuals may differ based on coverage and cost; however, products that do not require reconstitution are preferred for ease of administration (189,190). Clinicians should routinely review the individual’s access to glucagon, as appropriate glucagon prescribing is low (191–193). See Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia,” for additional information on hypoglycemia and glucagon in individuals with diabetes.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n9.27 Monitor for signs of overbasalization during insulin therapy, such as significant bedtime-to-morning or postprandial-to-preprandial glucose differential, occurrences of hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high glycemic variability. When overbasalization is suspected, a thorough reevaluation should occur promptly to further tailor therapy to the individual’s needs. E\n\n9.28 Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals requiring intensive insulin therapy or at high risk for hypoglycemia. Family, caregivers, school personnel, and others providing support to these individuals should know its location and be educated on how to administer it. Glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution are preferred. B\n\n9.29 Routinely assess all people with diabetes for financial obstacles that could impede their diabetes management. Clinicians, members of the diabetes care team, and social services professionals should work collaboratively, as appropriate and feasible, to support these individuals by implementing strategies to reduce costs, thereby improving their access to evidence-based care. E\n\n9.30 In adults with diabetes and cost-related barriers, consider use of lower-cost medications for glycemic management (i.e., metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and human insulin) within the context of their risks for hypoglycemia, weight gain, cardiovascular and kidney events, and other adverse effects. E\n---\n# Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\n\nIt is therefore essential to screen all people with diabetes for financial concerns and cost-related barriers to care and to engage members of the health care team, including pharmacists, certified diabetes care and education specialists, social workers, community health workers, community paramedics, and others, to identify cost-saving opportunities for medications, diabetes durable medical equipment, and glucagon (203).\n\n# SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND POPULATIONS\n\n# Recommendations\n\n9.31a Use of compounded products that are not approved by the FDA is not recommended due to uncertainty about their content and resulting concerns about safety, quality, and effectiveness. E\n\n9.31b If a glucose-lowering medication is unavailable (e.g., in shortage), it is recommended to switch to a different FDA-approved medication with similar efficacy, as clinically appropriate. E\n\n9.31c Upon resolution of the unavailability (e.g., shortage), reassess the appropriateness of resuming the original FDA-approved medication. E\n\n9.32a Individuals with diabetes of childbearing potential should be counseled on contraception options and the impact of some glucose-lowering medications on contraception efficacy. C\n\n9.32b A person-centered shared decision-making approach to preconception planning is essential for all individuals with diabetes and of childbearing potential. A\n\nPreconception planning should address attainment of glycemic goals, the time frame for discontinuing noninsulin glucose-lowering medications, E and optimal glycemic management in preparation for pregnancy. A\n\n9.33 Educate individuals with diabetes who are at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis and/or follow a ketogenic eating pattern and who are treated with SGLT inhibitors on the risks and signs of ketoacidosis and methods of risk mitigation management, and provide them with appropriate tools for accurate ketone measurement (i.e., serum b-hydroxybutyrate).

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (agents that block programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1] and programmed cell death protein ligand 1 [PD-L1]) suppress physiologic blocks on immune responses, which can result in autoimmune toxicities, including autoimmune diabetes (incidence approximately ≤1%). ICI-diabetes is an insulin-deficient phenotype that presents as acute severe hyperglycemia or DKA and appears to occur more abruptly than type 1 diabetes (216–218).\n\nAlpelisib, a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, frequently results in hyperglycemia by inhibiting PI3Kα, which systemically blocks the intracellular action of insulin, resulting in a transient state of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia (219). Hyperglycemia occurs early during therapy (median time of onset of about 2 weeks from initiation of alpelisib) with an incidence of ~60% overall and typically resolves upon treatment cessation (220–222). Metformin is the first-line oral agent to treat alpelsib-induced hyperglycemia, and prophylactic initiation of metformin has been recommended for people with prediabetes receiving alpelsib (223). SGLT2 inhibitors and pioglitazone are appropriate second- or third-line agents, depending on side effect and clinical profiles, and may be used in combination with or without metformin. Insulin and sulfonylureas should be considered last-line agents, as insulin can reactivate the PI3K pathway, negating the effects of alpelisib (223,224).\n---\n| Insulins | Compounds | Dosage form/product | Median AWP (min, max)* | Median NADAC (min, max)* |\n|----------|------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Rapid-acting | • Aspart | U-100 vial | $87† | $70† |\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $107† | $86† |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $112† | $90† |\n| | • Aspart (\"faster acting product\") | U-100 vial | $347 | $278 |\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $430 | $344 |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $447 | $357 |\n| | • Glulisine | U-100 vial | $102 | $82 |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $132 | $105 |\n| | • Inhaled insulin | Inhalation cartridges | $1,503 | $1,298 |\n| | • Lispro | U-100 vial | $30† | $24† |\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $123 | $98 |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $127† | $102† |\n| | | U-200 prefilled pen | $424 | $339 |\n| | • Lispro-aabc | U-100 vial | $330 | $263 |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $424 | $339 |\n| | | U-200 prefilled pen | $424 | $339 |\n| | • Lispro follow-on product | U-100 vial | $118 | $94 |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $151 | $121 |\n| Short-acting | • Human regular | U-100 vial | $58 ($54, $58)‡ | $46 ($43, $58)‡ |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $73 ($54, $178) | $58 |\n| Intermediate-acting | • Human NPH | U-100 vial | $58 ($54, $58)‡ | $45 ($43, $46)‡ |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $93 ($73, $113) | $74 ($58, $91) |\n| Concentrated human regular insulin | • U-500 human regular insulin | U-500 vial | $178 | $142 |\n| | | U-500 prefilled pen | $230 | $184 |\n| Long-acting | • Degludec | U-100 vial | $142† | $114† |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $142† | $114† |\n| | | U-200 prefilled pen | $85† | $114† |\n| | • Glargine | U-100 vial | $77 | $109† |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $77 | $109† |\n| | | U-300 prefilled pen | $152† | $122† |\n| | • Glargine biosimilar/follow-on products | U-100 vial | $118 ($76,† $323) | $61† |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $118 ($74,† $323) | $59 ($59,† $209) |\n| Premixed insulin products | • Aspart 70/30 | U-100 vial | $87†‡ | $69†‡ |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $112†‡ | $90†‡ |\n| | • Lispro 50/50 | U-100 vial | $102 | NA |\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $127 | $102 |\n| | • Lispro 75/25 | U-100 vial |",

Metformin is the first-line treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to mTOR inhibitor treatment, with insulin and other noninsulin treatments added in a stepwise fashion dependent on glucose level (225).\n\nTherapeutic Strategies for Individuals With Other Types of Diabetes\nIndividuals with pancreatogenic diabetes may require early insulin initiation to achieve and maintain glycemic goals. In\n---\n# S200 Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\n\n# Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025\n\nIndividuals with a history of pancreatitis, use of incretin medications (i.e., GLP-1 RAs, GIP and GLP-1 RA, and DPP-4 inhibitors) should be avoided (see Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes”). Individuals with cystic fibrosis–related diabetes should be treated with insulin therapy; insulin pump therapy, including automated insulin delivery systems, should be considered when appropriate (226).\n\nThere are limited data to inform the optimal pharmacologic management of post-transplant diabetes (227) (see Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes”). While immediately posttransplant many individuals require insulin therapy, noninsulin therapies can be used for long-term management. Studies of metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, and pioglitazone in individuals who have undergone kidney, heart, or liver transplantation have demonstrated effectiveness and safety but are limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up, and risk of bias due to retrospective or single-arm prospective designs (228).\n\nMetformin should be used with caution; it should not be initiated if eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m², it should be stopped with eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m², and it should not be used in the setting of clinical instability due to concerns for acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis. Metformin use may be associated with lower risks of cardiac allograph vasculopathy after heart transplantation (229) and all-cause, malignancy-related, and infection-related mortality after kidney transplantation (230).\n\nGLP-1 RA therapy may be preferred for many individuals due to the demonstrated benefit of GLP-1 RAs on cardiovascular, kidney, weight, and liver outcomes. Studies have not found evidence of drug interaction with immunosuppression, including finding no changes in dosing or toxicity (231–233).\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors may be similarly preferred for individuals with ASCVD, HF, and CKD and appear to be safe and effective in post-transplantation diabetes. However, there is increased risk of genitourinary tract infection, which is a concern in individuals receiving immunosuppression and in those who have undergone kidney transplantation.\n\nIndividuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to HNF1A and HNF4A mutations can be treated with low-dose sulfonylurea therapy but may ultimately require insulin therapy (234) (see Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes”) (Table 2.7).\n\n# SGLT Inhibition and Risk of Ketosis\n\nIndividuals with type 1 diabetes (84,236) and insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for DKA with SGLT inhibitor therapy. SGLT inhibitor–associated DKA occurs in approximately 4% of people with type 1 diabetes; the risk can be 5–17 times higher than that in people with T1D not treated with SGLT inhibitors (237). It is important to note that SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for use in people with type 1 diabetes. In contrast, DKA is uncommon in people with type 2",

SGLT inhibitor–associated DKA occurs in approximately 4% of people with type 1 diabetes; the risk can be 5–17 times higher than that in people with T1D not treated with SGLT inhibitors (237). It is important to note that SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for use in people with type 1 diabetes. In contrast, DKA is uncommon in people with type 2 diabetes treated with SGLT inhibitors, with an estimated incidence of 0.6–4.9 events per 1,000 person-years (238).\n\nRisk factors for DKA in individuals with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes treated with SGLT inhibitors include very-low-carbohydrate diets, prolonged fasting, dehydration, excessive alcohol intake, and other common precipitating factors (84,236). Up to a third of people treated with SGLT2 inhibitors who developed DKA present with glucose levels <200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) (239), and in one study 71% presented with glucose levels ≤250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) (240); therefore, it is important to educate at-risk individuals about the signs and symptoms of DKA and DKA mitigation and management and to prescribe accurate tools for ketone measurement. Individuals who have experienced DKA should not be treated with SGLT inhibition. Additional guidance on DKA risk mitigation is available in Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia.”\n\n# References\n\n1.
